# obsidian-dark-pdf

- Obsidian plugin for PDFs: all files with the extension `.invert.pdf` instead of `.pdf` will be inverted when opened and in page embeds.
- This should work for desktop and mobile (tested in emulator for mobile).

## Notes

- A slight delay is added to PDF loads to prevent a white flash, tbh not exactly sure what causes that but the delay fixes it.

## Potential Future Features

- Make it work for hover popup previews.
- Add a toggle setting or hotkey or something.
